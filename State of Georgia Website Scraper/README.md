# Solicitation Details Scraper

This Python-based web scraping tool automates the extraction of solicitation details from [Georgia's procurement website](https://fscm.teamworks.georgia.gov/psc/supp/SUPPLIER/ERP/c/SCP_PUBLIC_MENU_FL.SCP_PUB_BID_CMP_FL.GBL?&/), capturing information like solicitation type, title, summary, due dates, and contact details, and saving it in a JSON format. 
It's designed for analysts, researchers, and businesses interested in procurement opportunities in Georgia.

## Description

This scraper aims to streamline the collection of procurement data, which is typically a manual and time-consuming task. By automating this process, the tool facilitates easier analysis of procurement opportunities, tracking of solicitation updates, and optimization of the bidding process. Utilizing Selenium for web interactions, it ensures even dynamically loaded content is accurately captured.
