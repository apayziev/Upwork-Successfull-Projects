If your company has a system that you feel will meet our needs, please submit information about your system through this RFI. \n\nThe State of Georgia operates nineteen (19) interstate weigh in motions systems (WIMS) for commercial motor vehicle identification, state federal safety compliance, and weight enforcement purposes. As a vehicle passes over the WIM scale, at interstate speed, the WIMS collect axle weights, gross vehicle weight, axle spacing, vehicle length, and speed. With this information the system determines the vehicle classification and weight law compliance. Roadway sensors trigger a license plate reader (LPR) and a USDOT camera to capture the license plate number and the carrier's displayed USDOT number, respectively. The collected LPR image is forwarded to state and federal data systems to verify compliance of registration requirements. The captured USDOT number is forwarded to USDOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) data systems to verify compliance with operating authority credentials, to include compliance with Federal Out of Service Orders. FMCSA data systems provide a carrier safety rating based on the carrier's historical safety data. An overhead, side view camera captures a photographic image of the vehicle, day, or night, for visual confirmation through a user interface. A fixed pass-through laser provides data for vehicle verification of vehicle height limitations. The WIM system creates a vehicle record consisting of the collected identification and compliance data to include potential violations. The system evaluates the collected data to create a vehicle sort decision of either bypass or report. The vehicle sort decision is communicated to the vehicle driver via duplicate roadway variable message signs in real time. The sort decision is communicated to enforcement personnel via a user interface. The enforcement notification will include individual axle weights and gross vehicle weight and any potential violations, warnings, or detected errors. After a WIMS \"report\" decision, the driver is directed to enter the station. Upon approach to the station, a ramp WIM will re-evaluate the vehicles weight and axle spacings at a reduced speed to verify suspected non-compliance of weight laws. A second sort decision is made and communicated to the driver and enforcement personnel in real time. The second sort decision will instruct the driver to proceed past the station in a specific bypass lane to reenter the interstate or to report to the static side of the station for further investigation of potential weight, dimension, permit, and credential violations.",
