Based on the original styles, with a blend of nostalgia and modernity, BALL is back in business for anyone with an eye for quality and style.

The G9, also known as the Harrington Jacket, is still one of the most sought-after pieces in the history of menswear. Along with its distinctive Fraser Tartan lining, granted to the Millers by Lord Fraser Lovat of the Lovat family, and recognisable umbrella yoke on the back, it’s evident the brothers created nothing short of a Classic. The G9 cult exploded in the 1950’s with its distribution in the United States and the adoption of the brand by high-profile celebrities in the film and music industries. In 1964, Baracuta’s G9 jacket became universally known as the 'Harrington' thanks to actor Ryan O’Neal, who wore it while playing Rodney Harrington on the sitcom Peyton Palace. Years following, Baracuta’s signature piece, was also adopted by several youth subcultures, including the mods, punks, skinheads and rockers. Baracuta's Flagship Store is in Milan, Via de Amicis 24.

There was a lack of representation and Besnik was committed to closing the gap and creating designs that were a representation of a new movement. It all started with a T-shirt: BLS HAFNIA’s first ever product was the spoof t-shirt. The limited T-shirt featured a rebellious play on the YSL logo T-shirt that was altered to say “BLS” which stands for ”Bedøvende’ Lifestyle”. While the word ‘Bedøvende’ is hard to translate, it is a phrase that resonates in many Copenhageners.

        "DESCRIPTION":"BURLINGTON - BRAND AND HISTORY Burlington stands for the typical British argyle pattern. This consists of diamond-shaped blocks that are arranged like a chessboard with crossed stripes in contrasting colours. Due to the Argyle as a core element, the British flair and tradition, the products have a high recognition value and become “Iconic-Products”. The individuality and strength of this style are the expression of an exclusive way of life, which interprets the 'Brit-Style' internationally and acts playfully with traditions. Especially because of the creative patterns as well as the variety and intensity of the colours the articles become modern „life-style products“ and let the customer make fashion statements and create a distinctive look. From traditional argyle patterns to on-trend products and seasonal items to holiday socks, Burlington represents every mood, style and occasion. Burlington‘s originality and uniqueness are highlighted by the Burlington clip and the “ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL” concept. Thanks to this concept, Burlington socks fit every foot and are therefore ideally suited as a gift. The roots of the typical argyle pattern lie in British culture. As early as the 18th century, the argyle was known as a symbol of affiliation with the Scottish clans. The most powerful of these clans, the Campbells of Argyll, ultimately made this pattern popular on socks. Since 2008, Burlington belongs to the FALKE Group, which owns the brand rights for the European, African, Australian and South American markets as well as the market in the Middle East. As a part of the traditional FALKE brand, Burlington has perfected its fabric and shaped the sock trend ever since. High-quality materials are crafted into original Burlington socks in Europe and at its home site in Schmallenberg. These include knitted hosiery articles as well as outerwear for women and men, which are certified with Oekotex100. The ever-increasing attention of the customer to the importance of the sustainability of clothing, the brand has taken the opportunity to expand its collection with an organic Capsule. Thus, Burlington becomes a brand that meets all wishes. ",

Among the sheepskin rugs, the off-cuts and cast-offs were piling up when James had a brainwave: “Slippers!”. And the rest, as they say, is history. A few stitches and a few years later, the sheepskin slipper was born. It was the very first Clarks shoe and the opening chapter in a remarkable story that continues to unfold to this day. In the decades that have passed since the young Mr. Clark’s eureka moment our shoes have seen social, political and economic revolution. They’ve seen fashions in footwear come and go, and come again – everything from court shoes and winklepickers to wedge heels, sandals and sneakers. They’ve tapped to the beat of crooners, rockers, Britpoppers and hip hoppers. They’ve walked, marched, strode and sashayed through an ever-changing world. New technology, state-of the-art facilities and our love of shoes means we’re not only the number one shoe brand in the UK. With continuing growth in North America, Western and Eastern Europe, India and China, we’re also the world’s largest casual and smart shoe company and the fourth largest footwear company on the planet. We’ve come a long way since Cyrus and James Clark and the ‘Brown Petersburg’. But their vision and passion live on in our shoes. You could say we’re following in their footsteps. ",

Each style comes with its own story yet remains true to our universe expressed through great focus on craftsmanship, comfort and fit.

Modern woman—forward-thinking, confident, and self-assured—succeeding in the world, while pulling off the balancing act of life. Responding and reacting to real needs—needs she knew because they were also her own, Karan launched Seven Easy Pieces with her first collection in 1984—and revolutionized the way women dress. A bodysuit, a tailored jacket, a skirt, pants, a cashmere sweater, a leather jacket, and an evening look. With Seven Easy Pieces, women could create infinite combinations with these easy-to-wear garments. Karan intuitively understood the need and desires of modern women, designing collections that could take them from day to evening and simplifying life, without sacrificing elegance or sensuality. As Donna’s own life evolved, she was confronted with a new demand: a teenage daughter raiding her closet. And so came the next generation New Yorker: DKNY. Since its inception in 1989, DKNY has been synonymous with New York, inspired by the energy and attitude of the city. Drawing on Karan’s original principle of designing for the woman who never knew where the day would take her, DKNY has transformed into a global lifestyle powerhouse: the dynamic wardrobe of everything you need to live a New York life—wherever that may be. MODERN. CONFIDENT. ICONIC. NEW YORK. More than 30 years later, Donna Karan is one of the most iconic names in American fashion. Her iconic silhouettes and innovative system of dressing remain as relevant as ever, now reimagined in a modern-day Donna Karan New York and the next-generation counterpart, DKNY. Caviar and pizza. Black car and taxi. The skyline and the street. Together, Donna Karan New York and DKNY are the two sides of the city that inspires everything we do. JAYMJAY is the exclusive Distributor for DKNY in Scandinavia.",

        "DESCRIPTION":"Back in 2004 ...we had an idea. At the time, denim was becoming over-designed, over-hyped and over-priced, and that didn’t sit right with us, so we set out to right those wrongs. To us that seemed like an easy fix. We would make it our mission in life, throw everything we had at it, and that’s how Dr. Denim came to be. We grew up back in the nineties. That was a good decade. We walked hand in hand with trouble more often than we probably should have, and, honestly, sometimes we still do. And we always had the beat-up denim to show for it. There’s a fine line between growing up and messing up; that’s where the good times happen. Some things never change. Growing up in a great denim decade, we were always going to draw on influences from workwear, streetwear, legacy denim, and above all our idea of what makes a great pair of jeans. Great jeans have a great fit, they last long, they look good, they feel good, and they’re good value. That’s what denim is supposed to be if you ask us. We started out as a garage operation. From our humble beginnings, we grew fast, and we grew big. Along the way, our jeans became staples in the wardrobes of people from all walks of life, from punk rockers to DJ’s you’ve seen on the biggest stages, to skaters, photographers, and, well, just about anyone who appreciates great jeans. We got a lot of things right along the way, and some things wrong, but we’re doing the exact same thing today, only better. We’ll never be completely done because this is no longer a fix – ‘denim and good times’ is our way of life. So, here we are, still doing just that. We’d love for you to join in. ",

Two Norwegian sister-in-laws with a commitment to design and create timeless designs that are made to last. “How are you doing?” is an essential question for us because our collections and designs are inspired by the people surrounding us in our everyday lives. Others prescribe a “look good to feel good” mentality. We subscribe to the idea of actually feeling good to feel good. The lines we design are sleek and clean, our shapes flattering, and we do not compromise on our materials which not only feel good to the touch, but feel amazing on you. What’s more, our basics are not just basic. Each piece has just a touch of French flair for that little extra that is the signature of ella&il. In November 2018, ella&il kids was founded. We have three children each and realized quickly that it was hard to find soft garments of good quality and a fair price for our kids and decided to create, ella&il kids. These are clothes for girls and boys from 1 month – 14 years. ella&il kids can today offer wardrobe essentials any child would love to have in their closet! The design expresses the Norwegian way of living through all four seasons, with a touch of French elegance. We also offer many of the designs we have for both children and women – our mini me collection. In March 2021 we launched our “il” collection. We always planned on designing the perfect basics for men, we just had to wait for the perfect time. That is now. At the end of the day, the women, men and children who wear our designs don’t simply look good. They feel good. And that is the essence of our brand.

Growing up on the streets in a suburb of Gothenburg called Kortedala, he wanted to create something that came entirely from him and Gothenburg’s unrefined street culture, but made in the tradition of his grandmother. ELVINE was born, and has since then offered casual no-nonsense clothes with a touch of smartness and great fit for a relaxed lifestyle in the city.

From an early age, Esfan developed his appreciation for craftsmanship, tailoring, and fabrics. Co-founder Inge Onsea travelled the world and lived in India for years, where her love for colors, prints and sequins deepened. United by their shared appreciation for creativity and playfulness, Esfan and Inge fused their individual experiences to create Essentiel Antwerp — a global brand synonymous with positive energy. The driving philosophy behind the brand is “less is a bore”. With an extensive ready-to-wear, every collection articulates the brand’s unapologetic, down-to-earth DNA.

Filson's Pioneer Alaska Clothing and Blanket Manufacturers, specializing in items to outfit the stampeders to the Klondike Gold Rush. The gold rush faded into history, but Filson kept listening to his customers and outdoorsmen kept coming to Filson for rugged clothing. Filson continued to make its products with the best materials obtainable and guarantee every garment it produced. Over time, the Filson name became synonymous with reliability, satisfaction and honest values, and by the 1960s, the brand's reputation as the premier outfitter for outdoorsmen had spread around the globe. Over the years, Filson's philosophy has never changed: make sure it’s the absolute best. It is therefore not surprising that the items that worked then still work today, over 120 years later. Comfort, protection and durability never go out of style. ",

The shirt is the start and end of everything we do, because it’s more than a shirt – it’s a rite of passage, it’s the uniform of the non-uniform. A true icon. Fred Perry has never adjusted its course for anyone. Never been a slave to fashion. Never tied itself to the latest subculture.

Each of these places fuelled my mission to cater to the contemporary woman, combining versatility, uniqueness and uncompromising quality. London taught me freedom of expression. Hong Kong broadened my perceptions of what style is. Milan refined my tastes and provided me with creative stimuli, as did Rome with her breath-taking culture and history.

I've always loved mixing the two styles, because that's the type of person I am. The majority of my jewelry is made on brass. Because here I have the opportunity to create jewelry with volume and raw surfaces. The jewelry is coated with either 24K gold plating or a silver coating.Finally, all the jewelry is given an E-coating to ensure a good durability of the coating. I work primarily with genuine natural stones, freshwater pearls, quartz and cubic zirconia. Some stones can be colored to achieve a specific expression. I think the stones and pearls give a beautiful feminine touch to the raw surfaces. All the jewelry is handmade. I am inspired by people. The cool type in the metro, the colorful one on the bike, the bohemian type in the café and the minimalist on the street. I can sit for hours at the airport, at the train station, on the bench in the street or in the café, looking at people. I use all these impressions to design my little stories in each collection. ",

Today over some 160 years later Pyrenex is still a family-owned business of the 5th generation and has developed and perfected unique skills in producing the world’s finest down. While some of earliest down jackets ever produced came from the Pyrenex factories during WW2, during an extreme frigid winter to protect prisoners of war from the cold, their expertise later moved into producing duvets and pillows. Later in the 60’s when renowned French mountaineer Louis Audoubert was set to climb the Himalayas, Pyrenex decided to create their first expedition down jacket - tough, technical and warm enough to protect him from the harsh elements. Pyrenex is today one of Europe’s biggest and most advanced producer of premium down and feathers. With a rich history and expertise, sourcing from the best farms in the world at the foot of the Pyrenees and extensive research and know-how, Pyrenex has been able to produce an exceptional top-grade, high quality down used in their down jackets today.

At the same time, we waste millions of tons of straw – mostly by burning it, causing severe pollution problems. We at Fortum turn this problem into a solution. Our Bio2™Textile uses straw, that typically discarded as agro-residue, as its raw material. Replacing fossil-based raw materials with this residue reduces land degradation and deforestation. We apply a unique technology that achieves raw material efficiency of up to 90%, minimizing the amount of waste and the environmental impact from CO² emissions, water consumption and use of chemicals. All this contributes to the textile’s excellent life-cycle assessment (LCA) results.  he biomass-based Bio2™Textile fibers can replace unsustainable materials in numerous applications. Combining agro-residue-based raw material with sustainable fiber technology presents an answer to the urgent need to replace the unstainable textile materials currently on the market. The Bio2™Textile fiber offers high quality, renewable and recyclable solution that has never been seen before. It satisfies the growing need of sustainable textile fibers.  ",

It was a great success. With a strong starting point in quality and style, Sebago expanded rapidly. In 1954, they completed the production of their 1,000,000th shoe, and Sebago shoes were sold in the largest American department stores. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Sebago expanded their collection with new models for women and began exporting abroad. In 1970, Sebago launched their most recognizable shoe to date: the iconic Dockside sailing shoe. Known for its hand-stitched moccasin construction, non-slip rubber sole and stainless eyelets, the Docksides remain an iconic silhouette worn by men, women and children alike",

Gothenburg, the city where Sneaky Steve was born, has always played an important role in our history.  With its industrial heritage, rainy winters and heavy salty winds, the city has always been our inexhaustible source of inspiration.  Just like all the hardworking heroes who have kept the city alive over the years.  But Gothenburg is so much more than a gray sky and cold concrete.  It is a city where many different subcultures thrive, with a vibrant music scene and where many fashion designers have begun their journey to international success.",

Sofie grew up with creative parents who were working in the fashion business with several retail shops. As a child she used to accompany her parents to factories, fashion fairs and all the way through the design process, and therefore knows a good, sellable design when she creates one. It began with a shoe collection in 2001, followed by a children's collection named PETIT BY SOFIE SCHNOOR in 2007, before a clothing collection joined the range. SOFIE SCHNOOR is currently represented in department stores, online, shop-in-shops, large and small retailers, concessions, and high-end design shops across all continents. SOFIE SCHNOOR is represented in 600 retail stores around the world, in addition to the brands three self-owned shops in Denmark.
